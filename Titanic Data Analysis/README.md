## Challenge

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone on board, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, by doing some deep data analysis, I am going to discover some facts that answer the question:

1) To check who were the passengers on the Titanic? (Ages, Gender, Class, etc.)
2) What deck were on passengers on and how does that relate to their class?
3) Where did the passengers come from?
4) Who was alone and who was with family?
5) What factors helped someone survive the sinking or crash of the Titanic?
6) To determine if the deck has an effect on the passenger's survival rate? Did the answer match up with your intuition?
7) To determine if having a family member increases the odds of surviving the crash?
